                <b>Vidyard launched a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-and-webcam-recorde/jiihcciniecimeajcniapbngjjbonjan?hl=en" target="_blank">screen recording chrome extension</a> in late 2016. Mid 2019, and 300k sign-ups later, Vidyard was ready for a self-serve freemium video product to advance what the chrome extension started. This is how we launched the Free tier of Vidyard's first freemium product.</b>

            <h2>Role and Team</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                As the sole designer for Vidyard Freemium, I worked with the team through the entire thing, from defining the user and product problems, to scoping the work down, to designing the visuals and interactions, all the way to launch and beyond. <b>The team included 5 engineers, an engineering lead, a QA, a product manager and myself.</b>
            </p>

            <h2>Video for all</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>As a newly formed team, <b>we were tasked with designing and shipping Vidyard's first freemium product within a quarter.</b> Our company mission statement at that time was <b>Video for all,</b> and we wanted to deliver an experience that truly embodied that statement.</p>
            <p>While Vidyard's main use-case for the chrome extension had been for sales outreach, there were clear indicators that the use-case could be expanded to help many more people better communicate with video. <b>Thousands of users did not fit into the sales persona and were utilizing the extension in creative ways:
            </b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>An author was using video to book conferences and communicate with coaching clients.</li>
                <li>A wedding officiant was using video to book weddings by sharing videos of weddings of himself officiating, and for general communication.</li>
                <li>A cooking school was sending out assignments and preparation videos for students to review before cooking classes.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>After analyzing hundreds of chrome extension user habits during my time at Vidyard, I found <b>the most successful people using video naturally:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Weaved their authenticity and brand into their video content in creative ways (whiteboards, logo backgrounds, and fun personalized intros).</li>
                <li>Provided an easy verbal cue for their viewers to contact or interact with them.</li>
                <li>Created and shared 5x more videos if they received 3 views within the first 2 weeks of creating a video.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                These data-informed insights helped us redefine the demographics we used to target, and provided behavioral insights into the feature-set that would enhance their communication. Our product goal ultimately became:
            </p>
            <blockquote>To help people authentically communicate and interact with their engaged viewers, using video.</blockquote>

            <h2>Activation and Proxy Metrics</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>With that goal in mind, we wanted the Free tier of the product to get people comfortable with using video communication in their respective environments and activate them. Naturally, the Pro tier would allow them to enhance their videos even further to engage their viewers, and provide more insight into their video content. Due to the aggressive timeline, we decided to build a basic free tier and launch it to judge it's viability in the market first. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Metrics that we measured were:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Time-to-Activation: Percentage of users who recorded or uploaded a video and received a view within 2 weeks.</li>
                <li>Retention: Percentage of people who returned and created more videos after 3 view notifications.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>   
                We found these two proxy metrics to be good predictors of users who had found success with the product and adopted it as a part of their communication workflows. These proxy metrics became defining measures of success for all free users.
