                Vidyard launched a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-and-webcam-recorde/jiihcciniecimeajcniapbngjjbonjan?hl=en" target="_blank">screen recording chrome extension</a> in late 2016. Mid 2019, and 300k signups later, Vidyard was ready for a self-serve freemium product to advance what the extension had started. This is how we designed the Free tier of Vidyard's first freemium offering.

            <h2>Role and Team</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                As the sole designer for Vidyard Freemium, I worked with the team through the entire thing, from defining the product goals and metrics, to scoping the work down to an MVP, to designing the visuals and interactions, all the way to the launch of Free and Pro. <b>The team included 5 engineers, an engineering lead, a QA, a product manager and myself.</b>
            </p>

            <h2>Video for all</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>As a newly formed team, <b>we were tasked with shipping Vidyard's freemium product within a single quarter.</b> While Vidyard's use-case for the chrome extension had been for sales outreach, there were clear indicators that the use-case can be expanded to help more people communicate with video. <b>Thousands of users did not fit into the sales persona and were utilizing the extension in creative ways:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>An author was scheduling conferences and communicating with coaching clients through video.</li>
                <li>A wedding officiant was reserving weddings by communicating with potential clients through video.</li>
                <li>A cooking school was sending out assignments and practice videos for students to review before cooking classes through video.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>After analyzing hundreds of extension user's habits during my time at Vidyard, <b>I found the most successful people using video naturally:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Weaved their authenticity and brand into their video content in creative ways&mdash;using whiteboards, logo backgrounds, and fun personalized intros.</li>
                <li>Provided an easy verbal cue for their viewers to contact or interact with them.</li>
                <li>Created and shared 5x more videos if they received 3 views within the first 2 weeks of creating a video.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                These data-informed insights helped us redefine the demographics we used to target, and provided behavioral insights into the feature-set that would enhance their communication. Our new product goal emerged.
            </p>
            <blockquote>To help people authentically communicate and interact with their engaged viewers, using video.</blockquote>

            <h2>Defining success</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Our first goal was to create a product with a Free tier that activated users by helping them authentically communicate using video. Our second goal was to create a Pro tier that enhanced their video engagment and provided more insight into how thier videos were being received. Since the extension launched with similar definitions of an activated free user, we opted to reuse the same metrics.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Time-to-Activation:</b> Percentage of users who recorded or uploaded a video and received a view within 2 weeks.</li>
                <li><b>Retention:</b> Percentage of people who returned and created more videos after 3 view notifications.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>   
                We found these two proxy metrics to be good predictors of free users who had found success with the extension.

            <h2>Existing and new workflows</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>We opted to use the extension as the basis for the new freemium product due to its large userbase and its pre-defined workflow:</b></p>

                    Explain the general loop, maximum optimization
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>While evaluating the extension experience for freemium, two limitations quickly appeared:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The extension had a limited recording-only experience, and would not help users who already have videos to share&mdash;as most people looking for a video hosting solution usually do.</li>
                <li>The extension had a limited channel of growth due to its reliance on the Chrome Store.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Fortunately, I had spent the previous year <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-and-webcam-recorde/jiihcciniecimeajcniapbngjjbonjan?hl=en" target="_blank">simplifying the Vidyard platform</a>  to get it ready for this self-serve experience, and I had already explored a few original workflows combining the platform and extension into one experience.</p>

                    Explain the general loop, maximum optimization
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We pared this concept down to its most essential components for an MVP that supported users signing up from:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The existing signup channel: A user signing up from the chrome extension.</li>
                <li>The new signup channel: A user signing up from <a href="https://vidyard.com" target="_blank">vidyard.com</a></li>
            </ol>
            <p>From there, I broke down the new workflows into pages, components, and states, and started working with the engineering team on the first release of the MVP. </p>

            <p>
                As we added more functionality, we also introduced a new limitation. We maintained the Vidyard "Free forever" promise of unlimited recording and uploading, but we also added an embed limit of 5 videos. Most brands or businesses had a higher traffic internet presence and would be better served by an enterprise tier if they needed to embed more videos.

                To help new users, and returning extension users being introduced to the new workflows, we implemented <a href="https://www.appcues.com/" target="_blank">Appcues</a>&mdash;a product tour platform. I designed customized tours based on the signup channels and usage metrics. The flows were described as charming and <a href="https://www.reallygoodux.io/blog/vidyard-charming-user-onboarding-flow" target="_blank">featured on the ReallyGoodUX blog.</a>

                <b>The new pages, components, and Appcues came together just in time with a coinciding marketing push</b> and it was all thanks to the organizational efforts of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/starkmike/" target="_blank">Mike Stark </a>(Engineering Lead) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashtonrankin/" target="blank">Ashton Rankin</a> (Product Manager) 🎉💃
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>We almost doubled the number of user-signups overnight!</b> The time-to-activation and retention metrics were meeting expectations within two weeks, and the external feedback was encouraging!

            <p>
                The fact that this was interpreted as a redesign and not a new product launch shows the care and coherency we were able to maintain for the extension users, something I am very proud of. We also made hundreds of design and tech decisions, all the while making sure we were preparing for the following Pro tier of the product.
            </p>

            <p>Part 2: 1000 paying customers within 6 months of launch&mdash;coming soon!</p>
