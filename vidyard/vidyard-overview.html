            <h2>Why Vidyard?</h2>

        <div>
            <p>Early 2017, Vidyard was looking for a Product Designer to work on a product primarily aimed at sales teams&mdash;humanizing their sales efforts by adding videos to their outbound emails and outreach. As I reflected on the increased use of video around that time, I saw the potential for a self-serve product for people or businesses beyond the sales use-case.</p>

            <p>I decided to join Vidyard as their first Product Designer.</p>

            <h2>User and platform problems</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                The main issue experienced by customers was the amount of time spent trying to change simple settings and making sure they had the intended effect&mdash;Vidyard didn't work the way people expected it to. From a design perspective, there had never been much thought put into the information architecture, the primary workflows, the visual hierarchy, or any design patterns throughout the platform. The Vidyard platform was <b>complex, aesthetically dated, and not viable for a self-serve model.</b></p>

            <p>This is what Vidyard looked like when I started.</p>

            <h2>Simplifying Vidyard</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>These were just a sample of the usability issues that Vidyard had at the time.</p>
            <p>I started working on improving the clarity, coherency, and aesthetics across all of Vidyard's products by creating <b>ConstructionYard&mdash;Vidyard's first design system&mdash;</b>and by <b>rethinking the complex information architecture that did not align the users' mental models with the capabilities of the product.</b> This was done through a combination of prototyping and constant user testing.</p>

            <p>While I was tackling these problems, I tried to keep one principle in mind while proposing changes in a traditionally engineering-led startup with constantly shifting priorities.</p>

            <blockquote>You have to find ways to iteratively and holistically improve the product's design and user experience, keeping the long-term goals in mind while also meeting the goals of the business in the short-term.</blockquote>

            

            <p>With that mindset and with constant iteration, this is what Vidyard looks like today!</p>

        <div>
            <p>The products that I worked on have all iteratively improved Vidyard's user experience while also increasing the viability of the business. These products have demonstrated a <b>4x increase in monthly active users</b> and have higher activation and retention rates than Vidyard's previous releases. Customers of the platform spent <b>50% less time</b> completing common tasks and became more confident with their actions within the platform. The design system had scaled to all development teams in the company and helped define the product quality bar.</p>

            <p>
                As the sole Product Designer on a newly formed team dedicated to shipping a freemium product, <b>I designed and shipped Vidyard's first freemium self-serve offering.</b> Vidyard Freemium launched with a Free and Pro tier and found product-market fit with a new market segment that Vidyard had traditionally underserved. The Pro tier gained a <b>1000 paying customers within 6 months of launch, and continues to grow.</b> The free tier is actively driving more revenue of Vidyard's commercial plans and is now <b>attributed to 25-30% of all revenue.</b> In fact, it's now a <a href="https://www.intercom.com/blog/podcasts/scale-how-vidyard-uncovered-a-multimillion-dollar-growth-lever-by-moving-down-market/" target="_blank">multi-million dollar business unit!</a></p>
            </p>

            <p>Try out the Free product, and check out the Pro press release.</p>

            <p>
                I worked on many different projects that were not shared here. I designed the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/vidyard/id1299832054" target="_blank">Vidyard iOS App</a>, parts of the <a href="https://www.vidyard.com/free-screen-record/" target="_blank">Vidyard website</a>, and many prototypes that were never released. While I always felt disappointed with the lack of progress on the iOS app and the prototypes, we had limited time and resources, and we couldn't ship a good experience for all of them. I now see these projects as small steps on a journey to define what Vidyard is going to be and I hope the learnings from these experiments are applied to future projects.

                Between where Vidyard was and where it is today, there were countless iterations, successful and failed releases, and even some nerf gunfights. The work is never complete, but I am proud of the iterative improvements that were made. <b>I also feel extremely grateful for the opportunity to work with such an amazing group of engineers and product managersâ€”none of this would've been possible without them ðŸ’š</b>
